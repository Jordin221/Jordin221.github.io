What progress have you made towards your goal so far? 
Even though I haven't had the chance to personally contribute to open-source projects yet, I am aware of how important they are for encouraging innovation and collaboration in the computing industry. I can't wait to participate in these settings and exchange and absorb knowledge from others. I have learn a little bit more about open sourcing about pulling code to my local drive and pushing it to my main. I have learn about edit code and making branching so it doesnt change my main code. I have learn quite abit about open source programing. What can I do to learn more about open source is looking at projects about open source and finding new ways to code. Good thing i have mentors to help with this. I would say I have incredible mentors with their assistance and knowledge of open-source coding, Emily and Silas can truly assist me in achieving my objectives. Particularly when it comes to understanding the best practices and methods for contributing to open-source projects, their advice and expertise are extremely beneficial. In addition, I would value their opinions on my code and any advice they might provide me to help me become more proficient in this cooperative environment.
