title: Goal Setting
---
Briefly introduce yourself: your name, where you’re from, what year and major you are at NSU.
Do you have any prior experience with open source? If so, what is it? (It's okay if you don't have any at all!)
What do you think is the strongest skill or characteristic that you can bring to your team this summer?
What skill or characteristic would you most like to improve upon? What can you do this summer to help in that endeavor?

My name is Jordin Jones, i'm from Virginia was born in Mississippi. I'm a rising senior at nsu and im a computer science major.

Although I haven't had the chance to work on open source projects directly yet, I am aware of how important they are to the development of creativity
and teamwork in the computer industry. I would be happy to share and absorb knowledge from such settings if given the opportunity.

I think my ability to rapidly understand and effectively express complicated subjects is my best asset to the team this summer. I can connect technical and non-technical viewpoints thanks to my knowledge in technology and C++ languages, which promotes better team relations and project execution.

This summer during my internship, I want to focus on honing my C++ and programming abilities. In order to do this, I intend to immerse myself in practical tasks, look for mentoring from seasoned friends, and set aside time for practice. I am confident that this concentrated effort will greatly improve both my overall professional growth and my contribution to the team.
