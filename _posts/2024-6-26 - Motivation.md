One challenge/impact I believe I could solve during my lifetime is the implementation/availability of technology in the education space. This would pertain mostly to k-12 education spaces. I've recently written a research paper for a Summer course speaking on ways to ensure some of the common negative side effects that push people away from giving children technology don't occur. Things like screentime and making technology use social in classrooms.

Recently I've been feeling more inclined to tell my bestfriend when I'm successful in something. We've both been developing alongside each other and it's nice to be able to share our newfound successes with one another. 

A new open source project I found is OpenAI. They're the same company that runs chat gpt and I think it would be really cool to learn more about the inner workings of chat gpt. I think it'd be a good project for our group. They use Python, Java script, and c++. They're very big however and have 169 repositories. There is a discord bot repo that ises Ptyhon thatwe might be able to work with.
