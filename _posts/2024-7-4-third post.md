Hi there! I have recently been fully occupied with a project that I call OpenSSF Scoreboard. The Scorecard is an automated program that evaluates many significant checks relatedÂ to software security and rates each check on a scale from 0 to 10. These scores might help you identify particular areas for improvement to increase your project's security posture. Additionally, you may evaluate the risks those dependencies provide and decide whether to accept them, consider other options, or collaborate with maintainers to make changes.
We are essentially conducting a treasure hunt and project research right now. There are around four of us, and we are discussing it and debating whether or not to participate.
