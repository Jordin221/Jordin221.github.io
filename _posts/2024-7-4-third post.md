Hi there! I have recently been fully occupied with a project that I call OpenSSF Scoreboard. The Scorecard is an automated program that evaluates many significant checks related to software security and rates each check on a scale from 0 to 10. These scores might help you identify particular areas for improvement to increase your project's security posture. Additionally, you may evaluate the risks those dependencies provide and decide whether to accept them, consider other options, or collaborate with maintainers to make changes.
We are essentially conducting a treasure hunt and project research right now. There are around four of us, and we are discussing it and debating whether or not to participate in the project. If we were to start the project I would say we would start by fixing the contribute code because the link is not working. There are several technical docs for the project that cover various topics.
- Functional Requirements: These would specify the goals of the scoreboard, such as monitoring and displaying open-source project security data.
- Design Documents: Describe the scoreboard system's technical specifications and architectural layout.
- Instructions for configuring the scoreboard locally or on a server are provided in the installation documentation.
GitHub Issues issue trackers used to keep track of bugs and feature requests. The quantity of open items and their current state (pending or under work) might provide insight into the degree of activity within the project and the community's willingness to rapidly resolve concerns. I notice in most of there programs they communicated through slack channels to communicate to one another. They all anwsering questions for each other pretty fast.
I think the biggest thing i find interesting is that there is so many files for one small project just imagine how a big project could look like. I'ts quite cool to me.
