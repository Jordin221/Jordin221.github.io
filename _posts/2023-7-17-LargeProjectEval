The second project I observed was a much larger project than the last. It’s called p5.js and it has 530 contributors, nearly 5x the amount that OpenSSF Scorecard has. P5.js is a code library for javascript. It was specifically made for designers, and it focuses on shape commands, image, video, and sound processing as well as animation. This open source project has a website p5js.org which goes into more detail on the project, their community, and contains some helpful resources. This project is pretty active from what I can tell. The latest pull request was open 6 hours prior to me writing this, and the last issue was open 2 days prior. They had 2 merges last week and a pull request opened 6 hours ago. For me to start on this project, my first step would be to go to the issues tab and check out the labels to see if that can help me narrow down what I should work on. They have two labels: “Friendly Errors” and “Good First Issue”, so I’d look through those to see if I can find anything that I understand or could work towards fixing. I’d also make sure to check their procedures for claiming and problem and creating a pull request. They have a plethora of resources in their “contributor docs” folder which looks like it could help with formatting my fix. They have an issue template and pull request template doc which is helpful, as well as a get started link in their readme to take you to a web editor to start using their library. Also in their readme they have a link to download their library to your computer. Of their 195 open issues, only 31 haven’t been commented on by another user. They have some older issues, which is something to take note of. I saw one issue open from 2018 with a user assigned to it that was discussed in March of this year. The issues are definitely being addressed. I saw in the discussion about the 2018 problem someone asked to take the problem over. Since this product is a software library it would take under 5 minutes for me to download and install it. For communication I’ve seen that they have a forum they use as well as a discord that they use. The most interesting thing I've learned during my evaluations is how open a community can be to really getting to know each other. I’d rather contribute to this larger project than the smaller one. I just have a better understanding of how it works, what it does, and how I could even use it myself.
