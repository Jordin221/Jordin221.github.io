Right now the biggest challenge I want to solve the expensive cost of of photo editing software. I've founde some software that you have access to by buying a specific camera brand. That's what I'm doing now fortunately, but I think that all companies should provide quality photo editing software with their cameras. I think that's more practical, but when I accomplish it I'm definitely going to tell my mom about it. She'd be very happy to see me merging my passions that way.

I found a softare called darktable. It's a photo editing software made by photographers for photographers. They have a website for it and their github is set up very nicely with a descriptive readme. I've seen they still have a very active community that is still writing out issues and requests. They us a lot of C which I think my group could learn very easily since we've all learned c++. The comments on pull request seem very well put together. I don't see any disrespect, and everyone seems very informed with what the change is and how it will impact the project if accepted. I think they've tested it before commenting. Here's the link so you all can check it out. I'm going to download it and see if I like the software and find it useable first. I think this would be a very motivating project, because if this works out I can use it and change camera brands without worrying about finding and learning to use a new piece of photo editing software.
