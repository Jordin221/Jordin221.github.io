A wonderful initiative called p5.js aims to make coding approachable and enjoyable, particularly for educators, artists, and newcomers like myself. For those interested in creative coding, it's all about making dynamic graphics and animations from within your web browser, which is really interesting.
This project is being worked on by a large number of people from various locations. It's also really active; new features and upgrades seem to be coming out on a regular basis, and there's usually a lot of conversation going on in the GitHub forums.I would start by looking over their GitHub repository if I wanted to get engaged. You may view what bugs are open there, as well as the contributing criteria and possibly even suggest new features or solutions.
