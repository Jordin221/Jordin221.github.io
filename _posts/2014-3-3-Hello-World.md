Hey Everyone! This is my first blog for OSRE Catalyst. It's been pretty great. I've taken a lot of photos, unfortunately I just haven't been prioritizing editing them yet. I'm really excited about getting around to them one I get my software situated. I've been having some issues with my display automatically changing colors, but I think it's good now. My most memorable photo is a photo of a ground hog our group met at a strawberry field. It was surprisingly friendly and we got to take a look at it picking strawberries and dragging them back into it's hole. I might be able to put the image here:

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
