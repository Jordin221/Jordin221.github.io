Hey Everyone! This is my first blog for OSRE Catalyst. It's been pretty great. I've taken a lot of photos, unfortunately I just haven't been prioritizing editing them yet. I'm really excited about getting around to them one I get my software situated. I've been having some issues with my display automatically changing colors, but I think it's good now. My most memorable photo is a photo of a ground hog our group met at a strawberry field. It was surprisingly friendly and we got to take a look at it picking strawberries and dragging them back into it's hole. I might be able to put the image here:

Well I got the image to work. I might scale it down a little, but for now I'll leave it. Emily, our project coordinator, said she'd love to be reincarnated as a small woodland creature so I named the gopher Emily.
