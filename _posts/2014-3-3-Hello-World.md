1. What’s one challenge you want to impact or solve with technology in your lifetime?
   
My one challenge is to solve teleportation... IMAGINE you can just bloop in a blick of a eye to any destination. Unfortunately it has a few challenges of its own. In actuality, we are too big to ever move at the speed of light. To start, it would require a tremendous amount of time and energy to accelerate every particle in your body—whether it is whole or has been divided into smaller pieces. I'm not worry though because I feel like i can find a solution.

2. When you’re successful, who is the first person - alive or dead - that you want to tell about it?
   
I would say my parents, who have always supported me in whatever I do and encouraged me to reach even greater heights than I have ever imagined, they come first in my opinion

3.Can you find any open source projects related to this area of interest? Using what we’ve learned so far, do you think they would be good candidates for you to contribute to?
An open source project called Teleport deals with infrastructure management and safe access instead of actual teleportation. Businesses like IBM, NASDAQ, and Samsung utilize it since it combines connection, authentication, authorization, and audit into a single platform. I would think what I learn so far probably not but it would be fun to see what's going on and there ideas behind it.
