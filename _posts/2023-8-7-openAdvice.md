For today’s blog I read a chapter from [Open Advice](http://open-advice.org/Open-Advice.pdf). The chapter I chose is Code, and I chose it because of the section titled The Art of Problem Solving. It just sounds intriguing. After reading it I don’t think it was as helpful as I thought it would be. I was thinking it would be more psychology, which it was a little, but I don’t have many big takeaways. I think dividing the issue and asking the right questions are good techniques however. I read that instead of just saying something doesn’t work and pointing out what it’s supposed to be doing vs what it’s actually doing can be very helpful. 

The advice I would give to a peer just starting is to just do activities that help you practice using your tools. The GitKit activity that we worked on would be a great place to start for anyone new to open source. I also think it’s best to try to conceptualize everything not only in a way you can understand, but in a way that’s still accurate.
