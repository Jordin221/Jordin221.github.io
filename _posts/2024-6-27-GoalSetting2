I'm Silas Morgan, in the fall I'll be entering my senior year as a computer science major at Norfolk State University. This is my second year participating in the Contributor Catalyst program so I actually have a ton of experience working with open source. I'm excited to work on some new projects this year as an Alumni Mentor for this year's cohort.

I believe my prior experience advocating for new changes to be implemented to large projects will help me ensure others are able to get their changes pushed through to the main branch of the project we choose.

One thing I can get better with this summer is my public speaking and presenting my research or ideas. I'm hopeful I'll be able to find a place for my lightning talk at this year's Fossy conference. I know it'll be a good opportunity to network and get myself as well as the Contributor Catalyst program's name out there
