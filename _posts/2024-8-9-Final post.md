title: Jordin's Motivation 
---
I feel that I was quite successful in reaching my goals during the contributor catalyst internship.Working with Openo My primary objectives included contributing to meaningful issues, enhancing my technical skills, and effectively collaborating with the team. I achieved these goals by immersing myself in the project, engaging with various issues, and leveraging the support of my teammates. Key factors contributing to my success included the guidance and feedback from my mentors, the collaborative environment fostered within the team, and my proactive approach to problem-solving and learning.

If I wish I had achieved more, I would consider seeking more direct mentorship or structured guidance on complex issues earlier in the process. In the future, I could benefit from setting more specific milestones and seeking regular feedback to ensure steady progress. A mentor could provide targeted advice on tackling challenging issues and navigating obstacles, helping me to advance more effectively.
