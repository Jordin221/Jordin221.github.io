Hey Everyone! I'm Silas Morgan. This will be my first blog for OSRE Catalyst. I'm a Junior [computer science](https://www.nsu.edu/cs/bs-computer-science) student at Norfolk State University. I'm also from Northern Virginia. It's been pretty great. I've taken a lot of photos, I just haven't been prioritizing editing them yet. I'm excited about getting around to them once I get my software situated. I've been having issues with my display automatically changing colors, but I think it's good now. My most memorable photo is of a groundhog our group met at a strawberry field. It was surprisingly friendly, and we saw it picking strawberries and dragging them back into its hole. I have the photo above.

I've had some experience with open source during a Mitre ECTF challenge. We didn't complete the challenge though we learned a lot along the way. I had some confusing experiences with Git and Github, but nothing I could use outside of that challenge. 

One of the strongest skills I can bring to the team this Summer is my resourcefulness. I'm pretty good at looking up how to do things I need to. I ask people for pointers sometimes, but I believe it's better to do some research most of the time. It can build independence and self-sufficiency, both of which are essential for a team where everyone is working on something different. 

I think what I want to improve the most skill-wise is my writing abilities. I'm very proficient at writing, but even so, it's something I could put a lot more effort into and start becoming a great writer. It's something I want to explore. I want to do some independent research papers. I'd write about random things I enjoy like art or technology. I also think I should also do more cultural papers like how video games impact the mind of the players. It's something I could benefit from alongside potential readers.
